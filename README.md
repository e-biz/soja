# What is Soja ?

Soja (the acronym for Stomp Over Java Api) is a lightweight STOMP (http://stomp.github.com/) implementation. It's a Message Oriented Middleware protocol which allow many clients to communicate with a simple syntax.
Development is currently focusing on the latest version of the protocol : 1.1

# Motivation

There are currently some great libraries wich support STOMP procotol. So, why did I created yet another MOM ?
I needed a project which fit the following points :

* Java implementation ;
* lightweight implementation ;
* one project for both client and server side ;
* and client need to be compatible with Dalvik JVM of Android smartphones.
